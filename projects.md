## Projects



### AI-driven Virtual Casino Host Project (March 2024 - April 2024)

**Overview**: This project involves the development of an AI-driven Virtual Casino Host using OpenAI's API. The goal is to create a system that tracks players' gaming activity, analyzes their behavior and preferences, and tailors offers to encourage increased activity at the casino. The project is undertaken by students of the Multidisciplinary Design Program at the University of Michigan, in collaboration with the MotorCity Casino marketing group. It aims to enhance marketing communication customization and implement AI-driven strategies for increased engagement.

**Technologies**: OpenAI API, Python, Data Analysis, AI & Machine Learning, NLP

**Key Achievements**:
- Conducted thorough user interviews and literature reviews to understand current business processes and relevant forecasting techniques.
- Utilized the OpenAI API and Python to develop and extend an existing AI model capable of generating tailored offers based on players' gaming data.
- Developed a full system prototype including a database and a basic front-end/UI, automating existing "high touch" marketing processes and allowing for the management of a larger number of customers.
- Implemented basic functionality for generating and sending informational emails based on criteria from the Casino Marketing Department.
- Refined the prototype and AI model based on stakeholder feedback and operational testing, connecting to Microsoft platform data streams for ongoing data collection.
- Incorporated functionality for generating individualized text for emails and suggesting clients for specific promotions, aiming for a high level of personalized engagement.



### MapReduce Framework Project  (March 2024 - April 2024)

**Overview**: Developed a Python-based MapReduce framework, drawing inspiration from Google's original MapReduce paper. This project focuses on executing MapReduce programs with distributed processing across a cluster of computers, encompassing AWS EMR, Google Dataproc, or Microsoft Azure's HDInsight. It aims to delve into the core aspects of distributed systems, fault tolerance, concurrency using OS-provided facilities (such as threads and processes), and networking via sockets.

**Technologies**: Python, Distributed Systems, Fault Tolerance, Concurrency, Networking

**Key Achievements**:
- Implemented a robust Manager component that listens for user-submitted MapReduce jobs, distributing tasks among Workers efficiently.
- Designed and executed multiple Worker instances capable of performing map and reduce tasks, contributing to the overall MapReduce program.
- Incorporated fault tolerance mechanisms to handle failures gracefully, ensuring system reliability and data integrity.
- Utilized OS-provided concurrency facilities and networking to facilitate communication and task execution among distributed components.


### Sarcasm News Headline Detector (January 2023 - April 2023)

**Overview**: Led a student team to develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing sarcastic from serious news headlines with 78% accuracy. This project involved processing a dataset of 2,500 headlines using advanced NLP techniques.

**Technologies**: Python, Machine Learning, NLP

**Key Achievements**:
- Spearheaded the efficient collaboration of a student team through milestones and code reviews.
- Demonstrated proficiency in data processing, machine learning, and teamwork.
- Presented our findings and methodology to faculty and industry professionals, highlighting our approach and results.

### Discussion Board Post Categorization AI (March 2023 - April 2023)

**Overview**: Developed an AI program designed to automate the categorization of discussion board posts into distinct topics. This project aimed at emulating human comprehension of content through the use of artificial intelligence and NLP technologies.

**Technologies**: Python, AI, NLP

**Key Achievements**:
- Implemented machine learning techniques to autonomously identify word-topic relationships, eliminating the manual curation of word lists.
- Enhanced the efficiency of content management on discussion boards by automating the categorization process.

### Computer Vision Project (March 2023 - March 2023)

**Overview**: Engineered a C++ program leveraging the seam-carving algorithm for intelligent image resizing. This project aimed at optimizing content by cropping empty spaces from images, showcasing exceptional algorithmic and programming skills.

**Technologies**: C++, Computer Vision

**Key Achievements**:
- Demonstrated advanced knowledge in C-style pointers, arrays, and structs.
- Enhanced debugging and testing capabilities through meticulous code analysis and optimization.
