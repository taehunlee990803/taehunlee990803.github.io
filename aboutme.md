subtitle: Why You'd Want to Connect with Me
---

My name is Brian Taehun Lee, a junior at the University of Michigan, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. Here's why I believe a connection with me is worthwhile:

Passionate about Software Engineering: I have a deep interest in developing software solutions that not only solve complex problems but are also scalable and efficient.
Intrigued by Machine Learning: My curiosity doesn't stop at software engineering. I'm also deeply fascinated by the potential of machine learning to transform industries and improve our daily lives.
A Collaborative Team Player: Whether it's a group project for class, a hackathon, or any team endeavor, I bring not only my skills but also a spirit of cooperation and positivity to the table.
Committed to Continuous Learning: The fields of computer science and mathematics are ever-evolving, and I'm committed to staying on top of the latest technologies and methodologies.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
