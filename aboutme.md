subtitle: Why You'd Want to Connect with Me
---

My name is Brian Taehun Lee, a junior at the University of Michigan, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. Here's why I believe a connection with me is worthwhile:

* Passionate about Software Engineering: I have a deep interest in developing software solutions that not only solve complex problems but are also scalable and efficient.
* Intrigued by Machine Learning: My curiosity doesn't stop at software engineering. I'm also deeply fascinated by the potential of machine learning to transform industries and improve our daily lives.
* A Collaborative Team Player: Whether it's a group project for class, a hackathon, or any team endeavor, I bring not only my skills but also a spirit of cooperation and positivity to the table.
* Committed to Continuous Learning: The fields of computer science and mathematics are ever-evolving, and I'm committed to staying on top of the latest technologies and methodologies.


### My Journey

My journey into the world of technology started in high school when I first tinkered with coding. It was then I realized the power of code to bring ideas to life. This revelation led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, where I've had the opportunity to delve deeper into software engineering and machine learning.

Outside the classroom, I've participated in hackathons, contributed to open-source projects, and undertaken internships that have allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the value of teamwork, perseverance, and innovative thinking.

I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow, be it through internships, research projects, or simply connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts. If you're interested in discussing technology, collaborating on a project, or just want to chat about the latest in machine learning, I'd love to connect.
