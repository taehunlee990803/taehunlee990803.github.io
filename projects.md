### MapReduce Framework Project  (March 2024 - April 2024)

**Overview**: Developed a Python-based MapReduce framework, drawing inspiration from Google's original MapReduce paper. This project focuses on executing MapReduce programs with distributed processing across a cluster of computers, encompassing AWS EMR, Google Dataproc, or Microsoft Azure's HDInsight. It aims to delve into the core aspects of distributed systems, fault tolerance, concurrency using OS-provided facilities (such as threads and processes), and networking via sockets.

**Technologies**: Python, Distributed Systems, Fault Tolerance, Concurrency, Networking

**Key Achievements**:
- Implemented a robust Manager component that listens for user-submitted MapReduce jobs, distributing tasks among Workers efficiently.
- Designed and executed multiple Worker instances capable of performing map and reduce tasks, contributing to the overall MapReduce program.
- Incorporated fault tolerance mechanisms to handle failures gracefully, ensuring system reliability and data integrity.
- Utilized OS-provided concurrency facilities and networking to facilitate communication and task execution among distributed components.
